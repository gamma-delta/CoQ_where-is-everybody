# Where Is Everybody?

Makes creatures able to tell you additional secrets during the water ritual. Specifically:

- Creatures hated or loved by a village will tell you where that village is
- Members of a village that worships or despises another village will tell you where the second village is
- Members of a village that worships or despises a legendary creature will tell you where their lair is
- Members of a village that worships or despises a sultan will tell you secrets from their life;
  good secrets for worshippers and shameful secrets for despisers.

This mod adds no new parts (its just Harmony) so there is not a prefix.
